### The Craftsman ###

My name is **Peter Aba** and what you're likely interested in is that I consider myself a webdeveloper since 2002. 
I always liked learning about my craft and I definitely believe in life-long learning.

Instead of boring you to death, here's a short list of things I truly value and believe in:

  * Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
  * Treat backing services as attached resources
  * Prefer stateless over stateful
  * Treat logs as event streams

..and everything else from **[12factor manifesto](http://12factor.net/)**.

### The Guy ###

From a personal perspective I love:

   * Music (mostly <a href="http://peethallgatzene.tumblr.com" target="_blank">rock and metal</a>)
   * Beer
   * Travelling

And some more of course.
