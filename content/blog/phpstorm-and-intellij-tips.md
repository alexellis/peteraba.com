PhpStorm
--------

I find Jeffrey Way's series on PhpStorm extremely useful even after 2 years of using the software. Please
check out his series on [laracast.com](https://laracasts.com/series/how-to-be-awesome-in-phpstorm).

On the other hand, Jeffrey uses a Mac therefore he's keyboard layout and keymap preferences are somewhat different from 
mine. Feel free to adapt whatever you like from both of us.

Short keys

Alt+Shift+P


Intellij
--------

I'm experimenting with IntelliJ for various reasons, but I found a couple of things missing.

### Monokai ###

The great Monokai style is not available under IntelliJ by default. You can still download it from 
[github](https://github.com/y3sh/Intellij-Colors-Sublime-Monokai). Installation instructions work just great. It isn't
perfect but in my opinion it's good enough.
