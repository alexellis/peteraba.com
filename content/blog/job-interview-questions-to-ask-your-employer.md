**Note:** I'm by no means an expert in this. I just made these questions up for my own sake. I did however look at posts
created by others, some by self-proclaimed experts. There was only one that I [actually liked]
(http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/07/05/30-questions-you-should-and-shouldnt-ask-in-a-job-interview/).

There are so many blog posts out there about questions to be prepared for as an employee as a developer. 
On the other hand we are often fortunate enough to be able to choose the company we want to work for. 
I even think that for team leader or lead developer positions you must ask questions like these to make sure that you'll 
fit in the company properly.

### Environment ###

1. You're looking for a new office. What are your key search terms in doing that?
2. What office size are you looking for and how big would the IT department be
3. Are you open for purchasing MacBooks for devs? 
4. Free cereals? Coffee? Club Mate? Fruits? Canteen?
5. Anything cool in the plans?

### Company ###

1. How would you describe the companyâ€™s culture and leadership philosophy?
2. How many people would I report to?
3. How many people do you report to?
6. What do you like most about this company?
7. Would you allow employees to do remote work partially?
8. Would you be upset to learn a developer has some video running on one of his screens? And in the background?
4. Marketing or IT driven company? Marketing or IT driven office?

### Expectations ###

1. How often do you expect overwork?
2. How would you compensate for overwork?
3. How are employees measured?

### Team Building ###

1. What personal attributes are you looking for when hiring colleagues?
2. How often would you find time and money to support team building events?
3. What are your thoughts on in-house educational workshops, talks and hackathons?
4. Do you expect to have budget for conferences?
