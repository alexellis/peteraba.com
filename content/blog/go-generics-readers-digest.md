The lack of Generics in Go have been discussed ever since the first public release of Go and this is one of the few
features the Go team has always declared to be discussed internally as well. However Go is a language which tries to be
as "small" as possible and all versions of generics discussed so far seemed to introduce more problems than what they solve.

On 13th of July, 2017, during GopherCon 2017, [Russ Cox announced the beginning of discussions for Go 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zbh_vmAKvk).
This inspired many experienced Go developers to express their feelings and opinions on Generics.

### Experience reports

The Go team is also collecting so called experience reports which they plan to use for finalising the feature set for Go 2.0. The list for generics can be found on [Github](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports#generics).
